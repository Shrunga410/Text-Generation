<p>The field of natural language processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements with the advent of machine learning, particularly in the generation of human-like text. This project delves into the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), neural networks to generate text by learning the style of William Shakespeareâ€™s literature.The motivation behind this project is to explore the potential of LSTMs in understanding and replicating complex language patterns, contributing to both practical applications and creative endeavors.
